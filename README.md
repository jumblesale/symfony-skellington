symfony 2.7 skeleton app
========================

This is a really basic Symfony 2.7 app with none of the baggage that you get from running `symfony new`
 
To get started just put your project name in `composer.json` and run composer install.
 
The generator bundle is still in there so if you would like to start building a bundle, just run
`app/console generate:bundle`

Have fun and be good to each other.
